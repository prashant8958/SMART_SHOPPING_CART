# SMART_SHOPPING_CART
Shopping is simple but waiting on a bill counter makes shopping too boring and 
a tedious task. Huge amount of rush plus cashier preparing the bill  is too time 
consuming and results in long ques. The modern technology has increased the 
standard of living for the humans. This resulted in large crowds at shopping malls. 
To handle the large crowd, we must reduce the process of the billing time. This 
innovative project consists of an automated billing system which can be placed 
within the shopping trolley. This automated payment system consists of a barcode 
scanner and a thermal printer which is controlled by Arduino. So, whenever the 
shopper puts any product in trolley it is detected by the barcode scanner and is 
displayed on LCD along with the price of the product. As the shopper goes on 
adding products, all products are detected by the module and therefore the price 
will increase accordingly. In case if customer changes his/her mind and doesnâ€™t 
want any product added in the trolley he/she can remove it and the price added 
will be deducted automatically. At the end of shopping the shopper will press the 
button which when pressed adds all the product along with their price and print 
the total amount to be paid. At exit for verification the shopkeeper can verify the 
products purchased with and ask for the suitable payment option. Hence this 
technique is an appropriate method to be used in places like supermarkets, this 
will help in reducing manpower and helps in making a better shopping experience 
for customers. The smart shopping trolley is designed to make the shopping much 
easier. The Smart trolley is equipped with a range of functions to create an 
interactive shopping experience between the user and the trolley.  The aim is to 
reduce the time consumption needed for the billing system.
